## 📂 Featured Projects
- **Health Insurance Pricing Model**  
  End-to-end actuarial pricing project implementing a classical frequency–severity framework in R. The workflow covers data simulation, risk classification, and premium calculation, with results deployed in an interactive pricing dashboard for non-technical stakeholders. Claim frequency and severity are modelled using key rating factors including age, BMI, smoking status, and number of dependents, and combined to estimate expected annual healthcare costs and risk-based premiums. The project mirrors real-world insurer pricing practice while remaining transparent and explainable.

- **Secure Steganographic Messaging System**  
  End-to-end secure messaging system that combines modern cryptography with image-based steganography to encrypt and covertly transmit sensitive information. The project simulates a real-world security product by incorporating threat modelling, adversarial testing, and recovery logic to evaluate resilience against tampering and forensic analysis. It demonstrates applied cryptography, secure system design, and information security principles.
